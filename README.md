# Efficient-Complex-Event-Processing-in-Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-CNN-BiLSTM-Model
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are the digital guardians üõ°Ô∏è of our computer networks, defending them from malicious attacks. This project presents a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model for real-time intrusion detection using Complex Event Processing (CEP).
